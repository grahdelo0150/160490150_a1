      <p>Florence Nightingale, OM, RRC, DStJ (12 May 1820 â€“ 13
        August 1910) was an English social reformer and statistician, and the
        founder of modern nursing.

        Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses
        during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers. She
        gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture,
        especially in the persona of "The Lady with the Lamp" making rounds of wounded
        soldiers at night</p>
