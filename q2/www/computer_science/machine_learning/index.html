      <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 â€“
        27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known
        for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose
        computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the
        machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first
        algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she
        is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a
        "computing machine" and one of the first computer programmers</p>
