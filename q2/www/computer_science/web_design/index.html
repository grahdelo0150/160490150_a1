      <p>Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (23 June 1912 â€“ 7 June 1954)
        was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician,
        cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly
        influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing
        a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the
        Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose
        computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of
        theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite
        these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country
        during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his
        work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.</p>
